### Features
- Records video and takes photos
- Flash on/off
- Front / Back camera
- Hold to recordVideo
- Tap to take photo
- Tap to focus / set exposure
- Pinch to zoom
- Looping video/photo preview with share button
- [Callback based (Great for RX)](https://medium.cobeisfresh.com/why-you-shouldn-t-use-delegates-in-swift-7ef808a7f16b)
- View based (Great for animation rich UI/UX)
- Supports background music (Doesn't pause Spotify etc)
- Stores photo/video in temp dir
- Throw oriented code (allows external handling of errors)
- Persistent app authorization
- Animated record button (white to red transition)

### Why use this camera framework
- High [codebeat GPA](https://codebeat.co/projects/github-com-eonist-hybridcamera-master)
- Low class scoped variable count (In order to better handle overall state)
- Setup errors can be handled from the POV of the initiator
- Operation errors is handled in the onCapture completion block
- Callback based (as oppose to delegate based) [More info](https://medium.cobeisfresh.com/why-you-shouldn-t-use-delegates-in-swift-7ef808a7f16b)
- Easily styleable (The camera view is separate from the UI view)
- No third-party libraries or Sugar
- Entirely programatic (No storyboard)
- Thoroughly documented (Artifacts and sideEffects etc)
- Uses [Linkdin style guide](https://github.com/linkedin/swift-style-guide)

### Notes:
- In order to keep things simple, The UI is CGRect based. Use your own Autolayout distro like SnapKit etc when adding additional UI

### Install:
- Carthage: `github "eonist/HybridCam" "master"`
- Manual: Open `HybridCamera.xcodeproj`
- CocoaPod (Coming soon)  

**IMPORTANT:** Make sure info.plist has these variables  
 ```

### Example code:   
```swift
self.view = HybridCamView()
view.camView.onPhotoCaptureComplete = { (image:UIImage?,url:URL?,error:Error?) in
   Swift.print("On photo capture complete \(url)")
}
hybridCamView.camView.onVideoCaptureComplete = { (url:URL?,error:Error?) in
   Swift.print("On Video capture complete \(url)")
}
```
### Todo:
- Add support for more orientation modes (Currently only supports portrait)
- Add support for error resolution from the POV of initiating the camera
- Make UI with AutoLayout ðŸ‘ˆ
- Make lib carthage support âœ…
- Add Spatial, Chaplin, Popsicle as an option to HybridCam ðŸ‘ˆ
